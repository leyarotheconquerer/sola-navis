Ludum Dare 43
=============

Brainstorming
-------------

Theme: Sacrifices must be made

Resources must be expended in order to win

So... gather things up in order to progress
To win you must get rid of them

Like an infinite jumping thing where you must get rid of lives in order to win

Mechanic: Get rid of health in order to win

Have a bunch of parts, have to make the thing that will be the sacrifice


Sacrifice time
Sacrifice resources
Sacrifice yourself
Sacrifice others
Sacrifice sacrificing?
Sacrifice, as in effort to get things done
Sacrifice as a mechanic
Sacrifice is the mechanic
Sacrifice working on your car
...
Right
...
Anyways...

Sacrifice?

Red shirts?

Have a limited supply of fuel, must be used sparingly to last as long as possible

Distract incoming monsters with redshirts

I like self-sacrifice better

And the collecting element makes things more precious to you

But if we do a simple collect and then sacrifice mechanic, what's special
and where's the fun?

Sacrificing woodland creaturs
Toltecs/Aztecs sacrificing
	Defend your tribe from being sacrifices... by pointing to your neighbors?
		By building defences?
		By building a better city... right?
		By building temples for them?

Game requires sacrifices
But you must prevent them as long as possible
Game gets harder while you don't sacrifice, but eventually you must sacrifice in order to progress

Aztecs fought
Aztecs built temples
Aztecs sacrificed captured enemies
Aztecs build canals
Aztecs farmed
Aztecs traded
Aztecs followed a hawk landing on a cactus with a snake in its claw, as you do

River rowing game where there are alligators
You must row foward, avoiding obstacles to reach the dock
But the alligators are gaining on you.
Sacrifice your rowing-mates to distract them while you get away

Survival game where you must capture other tribesmen and return them to your temple as sacrifices
If you don't:
	Maybe natural disasters?
	Maybe others come to get you?
Other tribesmen are trying to get you?
You can apease others by handing over your captives?


Welcome to the great city of whatever
Surrounding tribes have come to pay tribute
Unfortunately, we have no where for them to offer their sacrifices
But, "sacrifices must be made", so we shall build a temple for them.
Unfortunately we have too many architects.
You must build the best temple to attract the most tribes men to offset the obscene building costs.

Build a temple
Make it big
Make it grand
Attract all the sacrifices
Gain all the profit
Make an even bigger temple
Make it even grander
Rule the world from atop your temple

Cons:
Already done a building game
Not really sure what choices there are for building an Aztec temple
How do you measure grandness
How do you measure bigness?
How do you effectively choose between these things?
What are the metrics?

Pros:
Aztec temples
Simple idea, if you can isolate the metrics
"Simple" difficulty mechanism

The basic mechanic is choosing a temple piece and building it
Or choosing an existing piece and upgrading it

You can have a metric of fanciness, which attracts more people
And a metric of size, which supports more people
You have to build in size, while maintaining some amount of grandeur

It may be difficult to provide modular temples that are interesting to build
That's probably the biggest issue with this idea
The prime enjoyment of the game is the joy of building a temple
If the temple isn't interesting
and the choices aren't interesting, why would a player keep playing?
Since my conception of the temple modularity has maybe one or two components in my mind... I don't suspect that I can make this interesting
Which is a pity, since I like the temple theme


Another idea which is likely be overdone is the collect things and sacrifice them
They might attack you, so you need to subdue them and bring them to your temple
Competition could be between you and other gatherers.
The other gatherers could be trying to get you.
Alternately, you could have a quota.

They key here is to give access to more enjoyable attacks and gathering techniques
while ramping up the difficulty curve.

Basic club
Swinging club
Spear maybe?
Carrying capacity increase
Better clubs?

Different types of enemies
Jumping enemies
Fast enemies
Heavy enemies

The sacrifices should influence the game

Maybe the each competitor must sacrifice to maintain vitality
If they don't sacrifice then they lose vitality
Once vitality is gone, they faint and can be sacrificed
Nice
Self-balancing

Motive, stay alive until everyone is sacrificed but you
Mechanism, bring their vitality to zero

And we can still use Aztec temples :)
Clearly a good reason for this concept


Sacrifices must be made
Spaceship
Nirvana
Heist

Sarifices:Nirvana Y
Sacrifices:Heist Y
IntoSpace:Nirvana X

Space junk, make spaceships into junk in order to get better spaceships
Now you have to navigate around the spaceships to get at the asteroids to get more resources

Fly your spaceship around the planet
Collect asteroids and bring them back to your station to collect a reward
Upgrade to the next greatest ship so you can carry more resources and harvest
better asteroids.
When you upgrade your ship, your old one will be destroyed.
It's pieces will get in your way, so be careful.

The question is, why would one or two ships be that dangerous
It'd be best for them to make a game play difference in order to balance difficulty as you get better ships
Maybe each ship can have a unique ability that must be given up in order to get the new ship?
Maybe you reset your stats when you get a new ship
Sacrifice your renown (pay rate) for a better ship

Win condition? Get the biggest ship? Get all the resources (which requires the largest ship?)

I like the idea of sacrificing your ship.
But the question is, what do you lose by exchanging your ship for another.
What is intrinsic to your ship?
Training?
If you let key components disappear, you'd end up with a lot of repetition.
But it's possible each ship may have certain disabled components which could be enabled at different locations
You have to choose which one to get and then fix it to a point where it's useful
The sacrifice is giving up your ship which is currently fully functional

Cons: Might be hard to point to the theme in this game
Pros: Sounds interesting
Cons: May be too in depth for the LD Dare

Limitations on ships:
Speed
Turning
Types of Asteroids Harvested
Storage capacity

Limits on components:
Max level components

Can only keep so many books on your bookshelf
You keep finding books
Keep only the best books
Each book has certain value
Optimize the value of all the books

Three different dimensions
What is the purpose of the books?
Maintain a library
Start with a shelf of books
Move books to a different shelf to prevent termites from getting to them
Construct new shelves free from termites
Maintain knowledge of how to build the shelves by preserving certain books
